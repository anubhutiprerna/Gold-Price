📈 Gold Price Prediction - Best Model Analysis

📌 Overview
This project aims to predict gold prices using different machine learning models. By analyzing historical gold price data, we compare various models to determine the best-performing one for accurate forecasting.

📂 Dataset
The dataset includes key financial indicators such as:

Date-wise gold prices
Crude oil prices
Stock market indices (e.g., S&P 500)
Exchange rates (USD-INR)

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python for data analysis and model building
Pandas & NumPy for data preprocessing
Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
Scikit-learn for machine learning models

🚀 Machine Learning Models Tested
Linear Regression 📈
Random Forest Regressor 🌲
XGBoost Regressor ⚡
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) 🧠 (Deep Learning Approach)

📊 Performance Evaluation

The models were compared using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R² Score
Among all models, XGBoost and LSTM showed the best accuracy for predicting future gold prices.

📌 Future Improvements
Incorporating macroeconomic indicators like inflation & interest rates
Experimenting with Transformer-based models for better predictions
Building a real-time dashboard for price tracking
