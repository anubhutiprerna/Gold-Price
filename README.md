# Gold Price Prediction - Best Model Analysis

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project aims to find the best model for predicting gold prices by analyzing historical data. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model evaluation to determine the most accurate predictive model.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

Source: Historical gold price dataset (publicly available or simulated data)

Attributes: Date, Gold Price, Oil Price, Stock Market Indices, Interest Rates, Inflation, etc.

ðŸš€ Key Objectives

Perform data preprocessing to handle missing values and inconsistencies.

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and correlations.

Test different machine learning models to find the best-performing one.

Compare models based on accuracy, RMSE, and other performance metrics.

Optimize the best model for better predictions.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

MySQL for data storage and extraction

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) for model training and evaluation

ðŸ“Š Analysis & Insights
